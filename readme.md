# Glowé – Korean Skincare Website

Glowé is a front-end practice project inspired by Korean skincare brands.  
The project focuses on building a clean landing page using HTML and CSS only, with attention to layout structure, responsiveness, and visual consistency.

The idea of the project is to apply what was learned during a front-end tutorial by building a real-looking website that represents a skincare brand.

---

## Project Structure & Flow

The website is divided into clear sections, each serving a specific purpose:

- The header contains the brand logo and a navigation menu with internal links.
- The landing section works as a hero area, presenting the main message of the brand with a background image and centered text.
- The features section highlights the core values of the brand using icons, headings, and short descriptions.
- The “Why Glowé” section explains the brand’s philosophy by combining text blocks with an illustrative image.
- The products section displays skincare items using card-based layout.
- The about section introduces the brand story with a balanced image-and-text design.
- The contact section provides basic communication details and social media icons.

All sections are wrapped inside a reusable `.container` to keep the content centered and responsive across different screen sizes.

## HTML Organization

The HTML file follows a clear and readable structure:

- Semantic sectioning is used to separate content logically.
- Reusable class names are applied to maintain consistency.
- Internal navigation links allow smooth movement between sections.
- Icons are integrated using Font Awesome to enhance visual communication.
- Google Fonts are used to improve typography and readability.

The structure is designed to be simple, scalable, and easy to maintain.

## CSS Design Approach

The styling is built with a modular and organized approach:

- CSS variables are defined in the `:root` to control colors, spacing, and transitions from one place.
- Flexbox is used for alignment in sections like the header, about, and contact.
- CSS Grid is used to create responsive layouts in the features and products sections.
- Media queries ensure the layout adapts smoothly on tablets and mobile screens.
- Reusable components such as headings and cards help maintain design consistency.
- Background images and decorative elements are used carefully without affecting readability.

The focus was on writing clean CSS without using any external frameworks.

## Visual & UX Considerations

The design follows a calm and minimal style inspired by Korean skincare branding:

- Soft colors to reflect cleanliness and natural ingredients.
- Balanced spacing to improve readability.
- Simple animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
- Clear visual hierarchy to guide the user through the page.
